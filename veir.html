                                During the summer of 2022, I had the pleasure of working at VEIR, a clean-energy 
                                startup working to modernize the grid by integrating high temperature 
                                superconductors and cryogenic cooling into transmission infrastructure. 
                                I was actually the company's first intern!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was ecstatic to expand my skills in a whole slew of fields: 
                                mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and design. 
                                I was also introduced to so many interesting fields that I will 
                                continue to explore throughout my engineering journey: 
                                high-temperature superconductors, quantum computing, and controls engineering 
                                to name a few.

							<heading><h2>PRESSURE CONTROLLER USING ARDUINO</h2></heading>
							<p>In order to automatically adjust the pressure difference 
								between two liquid nitrogen tanks, I created 
								prototype relay-controlled and PID pressure controllers. 
								This was my first time working with an Arduino and I really 
								enjoyed mixing programming with electrical engineering.	
							</p>
							<p>
								This project was a prototype for my coworker to then adjust 
								as the pressure sensor valves came in. Since I didn't have 
								sensors and valves to test my code on, I used a relay shield 
								to ensure that my code was working as expected.

				<!-- Relay-Controlled -->
				<div id="main">
					<div class="inner">
						<heading><h2>RELAY-CONTROLLED</h2></heading>
						<p>In the case that the actual implementation requires a simpler controller, 
							I created this relay-controlled pressure controller. As shown in the diagram above, 
							if the pressure goes above a certain level, 
							the vapor valve turns on and vice versa. 
							I used two relays to represent these two valves. 
							I used a potentiometer as an input and utilized the serial monitor 
							in the Arduino IDE to track how much voltage (AKA pressure) was being inputted.</p>

				<!-- PID Controller -->
				<div id="main">
					<div class="inner">
						<heading><h2>PID CONTROLLER</h2></heading>
						<p>In the case that the actual implementation requires a more sensitive controller, 
							I researched the implementation of a PID controller. 
							PID controller can get very mathematically complex and can be quite difficult 
							to tune. This was my first introduction to controls engineering through PID 
							controllers, and I found the process of it very interesting, 
							albeit the fact that it got quite complex at times.</p>
						<p>PID controllers can utilize proportional (P), integral (I), and derivative (D) calculations, 
							but this type of controller can be created with any amount of these three parts. 
							Almost 90% of controllers in industry are some level of PID controller.</p>
						
						<heading><h3>PARTS OF A PID CONTROLLER</h3></heading>
						<p><strong><u>P</u>roportional:</strong> Big immediate reaction on the output.</p>
						<p><strong><u>D</u>erivative:</strong> Tracks the past, since it's adding up values over time.</p>
						<p><strong><u>I</u>ntegral:</strong> Predicts where the output is going.</p>

						<p>Tuning the PID controller to the right settings can also be extremely challenging. 
							The way to tune a PID controller is to adjust the constant in the beginning of 
							each of the PID calculations.</p>

						<p>Diagram of a general PID controller (left); Example of different ways to tune a PID controller (right).</p>
						<p>Since the company did not have pressure sensor valves to test on, there wasn't a way for me to tune the PID controller. 
							I spent time researching the best libraries to use and understanding how PID controllers work and how to tune them. 
							Overall, I had a great time with this project and look forward to continuing to explore controls engineering and 
							working with Arduino.</p>
